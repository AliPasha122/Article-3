Despite advancements in desalination and wastewater treatment technologies, freshwater
scarcity continues to be a pressing global issue, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.
Traditional sources such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater are either depleted or polluted. An
untapped solution lies in harvesting the atmosphere's abundant water vapor—an estimated
13 trillion liters of water, sufficient to meet global freshwater needs multiple times over.
However, capturing this resource efficiently and sustainably has remained a technological
challenge.
